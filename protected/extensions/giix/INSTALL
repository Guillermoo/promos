Installing giix 
===============

Before installing
-----------------

1) Make sure you read the Yii guide at <http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide>.
2) Read the Gii documentation at <http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/GiiModule>.
3) Read giix README file. Please give special attention to the "requirements" section.

Installing
----------

1) Extract the directories "giix-core" and "giix-components" from the
downloaded archive into your application's protected/extensions directory.

2) Configure the gii generator path in your application, like:
'modules' => array(
	'gii' => array(
		'class' => 'system.gii.GiiModule',
		'generatorPaths' => array(
			'ext.giix-core', // giix generators
		),
	),
),

3) Configure your application to automatically load the giix component classes
when needed, like:
'import' => array(
	...
	'ext.giix-components.*', // giix components
),

It is recommended to set at least the 'password' and 'ipFilters' properties
in gii for security.
For more information see the gii documentation at <http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/GiiModule>.

Additionaly, you may remove the entire 'giix-core' directory and generator
configuration (step 2 above) when releasing your Web application for improved
security.
